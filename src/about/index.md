My professional career in web development began in earnest around **2006**.
My love for it began in 2002 making websites on Homestead about my favorite
anime series. My interest in anime has faded, but I still enjoy working on
the web!

The first gig was for a company called [**Optimal Outsource**][optimal-outsource] in **2006**. We did mailings for
property management companies. I started there running the mail inserters and
manually processing customer data – csv's, excel and the like. With a good understanding of the problem I built
our first online ordering system. Our clients were now able to submit orders
and check on progress… A big improvement over emailing data files and waiting
for a response. I wrote the initial system in PHP along with your typical LAMP
stack. After about 2 years I helped rewrite the system in Python on top of
Django which allowed easier processing and maintenance thanks to the
provided admin panel. In **2010** I left to find my next project.

I was living in Orange County and taking time to find a good fit for work.
This resulted in insufficient funds, but I was able to afford a trip up to
San Francisco to attend the first Github Developers conference. It was here I
met some cool people and found my next project at [**Trulia**][trulia].

Trulia provided my first real experience in developing for a large audience.
Very exciting! Initially tasked with building out a full map experience for
property and housing searches I also worked on a home page refresh and eventually
settled in a new team for tackling our mortgage offerings. I also helped
the company transition in to new technologies and methodologies. I was a part of
the team that migrated engineering from SVN to GIT and worked with [Nicole Sullivan][nicole] and her talented crew to help get our stylesheets in to shape.

A year and a half in I had seen [Zach Klein][zach] seeding out hints of a new company
he was starting called [**DIY**][diy]. It was the first project since starting at Trulia
that got my dev senses tingling. I had an opportunity to join their small and
smart team so in **2012** I dove in to the startup world!

Under [Andrew Sliwinski's][andrew] awesome guidance I got heavily in to Node.JS. I was
hooked! Working in such a small team I got to touch almost every part of
the web experience. Design and engineering worked very closely
(the office was a tiny laundromat :p) from conception through implementation of
features and entire flows. Here I also developed my skills for product planning
and management which helped me appreciate the entire development process holistically. Some
notable products I helped ship are the membership offering [Extra Awesome][diy-ea],
a mobile friendly revamp of our [join flow][diy-join] increasing conversion and
d3 powered user insights in to their progress on DIY.

Now in **2015** I'm looking for another project to work on! I'm at a place in my
career where I not only want to create great work, but I'm excited about helping
others do great and meaningful work as well.

If you made it through all that: congrats! If you're interested in a quick
skill summary I'm proficient in most dynamic languages. I've written a lot of
**PHP**, **Python** and **JavaScript** and am commited to contributing to
Open Source. My heart is currently with the **Node** community and with tools
like **Browserify** and **NPM**, but I never let technology ultimately dictate
what I work on. I am also passionate about **HTML** standards, accessibility and
general frontend performance. I can sometimes get lost in writing **CSS** while
making sure a transition feels right or solving some quirky rendering bug.
I geek out on ops tech like **Continuous Integration**, **Docker**, **AWS** and
general configuration management.
