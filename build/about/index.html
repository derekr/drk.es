    <div class="container"><p>My professional career in web development began in earnest around <strong>2006</strong>.
My love for it began in 2002 making websites on Homestead about my favorite
anime series. My interest in anime has faded, but I still enjoy working on
the web!</p>
<p>The first gig was for a company called <a href="http://optimaloutsource.com/" title="Optimal Outsource"><strong>Optimal Outsource</strong></a> in <strong>2006</strong>. We did mailings for
property management companies. I started there running the mail inserters and
manually processing customer data – csv’s, excel and the like. With a good understanding of the problem I built
our first online ordering system. Our clients were now able to submit orders
and check on progress… A big improvement over emailing data files and waiting
for a response. I wrote the initial system in PHP along with your typical LAMP
stack. After about 2 years I helped rewrite the system in Python on top of
Django which allowed easier processing and maintenance thanks to the
provided admin panel. In <strong>2010</strong> I left to find my next project.</p>
<p>I was living in Orange County and taking time to find a good fit for work.
This resulted in insufficient funds, but I was able to afford a trip up to
San Francisco to attend the first Github Developers conference. It was here I
met some cool people and found my next project at <a href="http://www.trulia.com/" title="Trulia"><strong>Trulia</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Trulia provided my first real experience in developing for a large audience.
Very exciting! Initially tasked with building out a full map experience for
property and housing searches I also worked on a home page refresh and eventually
settled in a new team for tackling our mortgage offerings. I also helped
the company transition in to new technologies and methodologies. I was a part of
the team that migrated engineering from SVN to GIT and worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/stubbornella" title="Nicole&#39;s Twitter">Nicole Sullivan</a> and her talented crew to help get our stylesheets in to shape.</p>
<p>A year and a half in I had seen <a href="https://twitter.com/zachklein" title="Zach&#39;s Twitter">Zach Klein</a> seeding out hints of a new company
he was starting called <a href="https://diy.org" title="DIY"><strong>DIY</strong></a>. It was the first project since starting at Trulia
that got my dev senses tingling. I had an opportunity to join their small and
smart team so in <strong>2012</strong> I dove in to the startup world!</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://twitter.com/thisandagain" title="Andrew&#39;s Twitter">Andrew Sliwinski’s</a> awesome guidance I got heavily in to Node.JS. I was
hooked! Working in such a small team I got to touch almost every part of
the web experience. Design and engineering worked very closely
(the office was a tiny laundromat :p) from conception through implementation of
features and entire flows. Here I also developed my skills for product planning
and management which helped me appreciate the entire development process holistically. Some
notable products I helped ship are the membership offering <a href="https://diy.org/membership" title="DIY Extra Awesome">Extra Awesome</a>,
a mobile friendly revamp of our <a href="https://diy.org/join" title="DIY Join">join flow</a> increasing conversion and
d3 powered user insights in to their progress on DIY.</p>
<p>Now in <strong>2015</strong> I’m looking for another project to work on! I’m at a place in my
career where I not only want to create great work, but I’m excited about helping
others do great and meaningful work as well.</p>

<p>If you made it through all that: congrats! If you’re interested in a quick
skill summary I’m proficient in most dynamic languages. I’ve written a lot of
<strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> and am commited to contributing to
Open Source. My heart is currently with the <strong>Node</strong> community and with tools
like <strong>Browserify</strong> and <strong>NPM</strong>, but I never let technology ultimately dictate
what I work on. I am also passionate about <strong>HTML</strong> standards, accessibility and
general frontend performance. I can sometimes get lost in writing <strong>CSS</strong> while
making sure a transition feels right or solving some quirky rendering bug.
I geek out on ops tech like <strong>Continuous Integration</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong> and
general configuration management.</p>
