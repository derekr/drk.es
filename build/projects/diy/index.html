    <h1 id="diy">DIY</h1>
<p><a href="https://diy.org" title="DIY">DIY</a> is a community for kids to come together to learn skills and share what
they make. Designing and building for kids is a fun and challenging task – it helped
working with a team that are still all kids at heart. It was fun coming up with solutions that were engaging, but worked within constraints put forth by things like <a href="http://www.coppa.org" title="Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act">COPPA</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to working on the website proper and other services I built internal
tools like a Skills admin site for our curators and a playground for designers to
sketch new web components with our type and base css pre-loaded.</p>
<h2 id="tools-and-technologies">Tools and Technologies</h2>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS</li>
<li>NPM</li>
<li>Browserify</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Transloadit</li>
<li>AWS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Kids could browse a <a href="https://diy.org/skills" title="DIY – Skills">wide breadth of Skills</a> and get a glimpse in to all
sorts of interests they may not have known they had. If they are signed in a
list of skills in progress could encourage completion and earning a patch as
a result. Clientside sorting and grouping made it really easy to navigate the
100+ skills on the page. Any new skills would have a <code>new</code> label on their card and
that would bubble up to the category navigation to the left. New and noteworthy
skills would display at the top in a banner with a random skill on each page
load.</p>

<h2 id="to-do-s">To-Do’s</h2>
<p>After launching Extra Awesome we had some room to work on a non-roadmap project.
I chose to work on adding support for bookmarking challenges to come back to. Kids
on the site had asked for the feature before and I always saw the activities you
could do on DIY were asyncrhonous so a feature like To-Do’s would be pretty beneficial.</p>
<p>On each Challenge detail view a To-Do button would appear as long as you haven’t
completed the challenge already. Tapping the button would add the challenge
to your To-Do list in your portfolio.</p>
<p><img src="/projects/diy/images/todo-button.gif" alt="To-Do Button"></p>

<p>Each To-Do item sports time and cost metadata meters. The color of the meter
will change depending on how many dots are filled in increasing the scanability
of To-Do’s that might be cheap and quick or expensive and difficult depending
on what you’re looking for.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>
<p>One of the last projects I worked on was a refresh of the <a href="https://diy.org/drk" title="drk on DIY">Portfolio</a>.
It was a much needed facelift and a preparation to support new features we had
on the roadmap such as custom avatars.</p>
<p>In the previous iteration you couldn’t view your entire skill grid. With this
update you can now scroll through your entire skill history. The grid was built
using an <a href="https://github.com/substack/hex-grid" title="skill-grid on Github">awesome module by Substack</a> with some additional tweaks to meet the
intended visual design.</p>

<h2 id="insights">Insights</h2>
<p>A part of the Extra Awesome offerings was access to your insights on your portfolio
as well as your parent’s dashboard. We hired Ri Liu for a data viz residency to
help craft the d3 visualization and I helped put all the pieces together. We
opened sourced two of the graphs used to make up Insights: donutchart and
radarchart.</p>

<h2 id="join-flow">Join Flow</h2>
<p>We never got around to making all of DIY mobile friendly, but it was important
to get the <a href="https://diy.org/join" title="DIY Join">Join flow</a> in shape as many of the kids and parents needing to verify
accounts were using mobile devices.</p>
